Regarding to the name of the site, [碼農](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A2%BC%E8%BE%B2) ("Code" "Farmer/Peasant") is the equivalent of "Code Monkey" in Chinese.

As for myself, I am a full stack developer.  I fancy myself to be a bit better than a code monkey, but hey, do I suffer from "[Illusory Superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority)"?





### Skills

My strongest skills would probably be __Django__, __Python__ and __SQL__.  Having said that, throughout my career, I have come across numerous technologies, and I feel those could probably be best presented with a word/tag cloud.
