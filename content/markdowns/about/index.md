Regarding to the name of the site, [碼農](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A2%BC%E8%BE%B2) ("Code" "Farmer/Peasant") is a Chinese term equivalent to "Code Monkey" in English.

For myself, I am a full stack developer.  I fancy myself to be a bit better than a code monkey, but hey, do I suffer from "[Illusory Superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority)"?
