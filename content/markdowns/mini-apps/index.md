To all amateur singers out there, here are two helper apps I have created:


[<img class="miniapp-img" src="music-note.svg" alt="Image for Tuner Mini App">](/tuner/)  [Tuner](/tuner/): This app tells you what notes you are singing / playing.  This will be useful to checking out for any out of tune singing.  Or it can be used for tuning any music instruments.  Music instruments are wonderful tools to hide any singing imprefection.

[<img class="miniapp-img" src="mic.svg" alt="Image for Reverb Mini App">](/audioreverb/)  [Reverb](/audioreverb/):  Do you find any singing sound better with a microphone?  The echo/feedback effect is another way to hide any singing imperfection.  But a microphone costs money, and takes up cupboaud space.  The Reverb App will provide a similar effect on a web browser.
