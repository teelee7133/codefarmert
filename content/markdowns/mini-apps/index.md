I am an amatuer singer, and I like to sing a song or two occasionally.  Before I go on, I must clarify I am not a music listener.
Probably that is why I stayed amatuer all these years instead of becoming the most popular singer of all time.

To help making my already wonderful singing voice sound better, I have created two mini web apps.

1. [Tuner](/tuner/): This app tells you what notes you are singing / playing.  This will be useful to checking out for any out of tune singing.  Or it can be used for tuning any music instruments.  Music instruments are wonderful tools to hide any singing imprefection.

2. [Reverb](/audioreverb/):  Do you find any singing sound better with a microphone?  The echo/feedback effect is another way to hide any singing imperfection.  But a microphone costs money, and takes up cupboaud space.  The Reverb App will provide a similar effect on a web browser.
